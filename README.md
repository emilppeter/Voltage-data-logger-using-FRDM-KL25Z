# Voltage-data-logger
System is designed using ARM Cortex M0+ based FRDM-KL25Z board to accept configuration information like sampling period and sample count using UART communication from the user and sample an analog waveform accordingly.The sampled values are then stored in the memory and later retreived and printed in the serial terminal when requested by the user.
